# Round 01 Development Backlog

## [2025-09-09 14:45] Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation

### Objective
Initialize React project with Vite, install p5.js dependencies, create basic app structure, and verify development environment for the React + p5.js Creative Sketch prototype.

### Context
Relevant files/dirs: `round-01/src/react-p5-sketch/`, `round-01/ideas.md`, `round-01/backlog/react-p5js-development-plan.md`
Following Idea A specification for Interactive Generative Art prototype.

### Plan (TodoWrite)
- [x] Initialize React project with Vite
- [x] Install dependencies: React, p5.js, react-p5  
- [x] Set up project structure with components folder
- [x] Create basic App component layout
- [x] Verify hot reload and development server
- [x] Create backlog entry for Phase 1 execution

### Prompts & Commands
- Commands executed:
  - `cd /mnt/c/Users/jbdbo/Documents/Windsurf/IDE-MPS/make-it-prototyping/rounds/round-01/src && npm create vite@latest react-p5-sketch -- --template react`
  - `cd /mnt/c/Users/jbdbo/Documents/Windsurf/IDE-MPS/make-it-prototyping/rounds/round-01/src/react-p5-sketch && npm install --timeout=300000`
  - `npm install p5 react-p5`
  - `cd /mnt/c/Users/jbdbo/Documents/Windsurf/IDE-MPS/make-it-prototyping/rounds/round-01/src/react-p5-sketch/src && mkdir components`
  - `cd /mnt/c/Users/jbdbo/Documents/Windsurf/IDE-MPS/make-it-prototyping/rounds/round-01/src/react-p5-sketch && npm run dev`

### Changes Made
- Created React project with Vite template in `src/react-p5-sketch/`
- Installed base React dependencies (151 packages) 
- Added p5.js and react-p5 dependencies (24 additional packages)
- Created `components/` directory for future component organization
- Completely rewrote `App.jsx` with creative sketch layout:
  - Header with project title and description
  - Main container with grid layout (sketch canvas + controls panel)
  - Placeholder areas for p5.js canvas and parameter controls
  - Export button for image functionality
- Replaced `App.css` with custom styling:
  - Responsive grid layout (canvas + sidebar)
  - Professional styling with proper spacing and colors  
  - Mobile-responsive design with stacked layout
  - Styled placeholders and interactive elements

### Results & Verification
- Project successfully initialized with Vite
- Dependencies installed successfully (p5@1.12.0, react-p5@1.4.1)
- Basic app structure created with components folder
- App.jsx and App.css updated with prototype-specific layout
- **Development server issue**: Node.js 18.20.8 incompatible with Vite 7.1.5 (requires Node 20.19+ or 22.12+)
- **Dependency warning**: react-p5@1.4.1 is deprecated

### Issues/Risks
- **Node.js version compatibility**: Current Node 18.20.8 incompatible with Vite 7.1.5
- **Deprecated react-p5**: Package no longer supported, may need alternative p5.js integration
- **Engine warnings**: Multiple packages require newer Node versions

### Next Steps
1. Resolve Node.js compatibility issue (upgrade Node or downgrade Vite)
2. Address deprecated react-p5 dependency - research alternatives
3. Once dev server working, proceed to Phase 2: p5.js Integration
4. Consider using p5.js directly with useRef hook instead of react-p5

## [2025-09-09 15:15] Phase 2: p5.js Integration

### Objective  
Implement p5.js sketch with React integration, create interactive generative art with flowing particles, and connect parameter controls for real-time interaction.

### Context
Relevant files/dirs: `src/react-p5-sketch/src/components/P5Sketch.jsx`, `src/react-p5-sketch/src/App.jsx`, `src/react-p5-sketch/src/App.css`
Avoiding deprecated react-p5 library, using direct p5.js integration with React hooks.

### Plan (TodoWrite)
- [x] Create P5Sketch component using direct p5.js integration
- [x] Implement basic generative art sketch  
- [x] Test p5.js sketch renders correctly in React
- [x] Create responsive canvas sizing
- [x] Add basic animation loop
- [x] Create backlog entry for Phase 2 execution

### Prompts & Commands
- Created new P5Sketch component with direct p5.js integration
- Updated App.jsx to include interactive controls and state management
- Enhanced App.css with control styling

### Changes Made
- **P5Sketch.jsx**: Complete p5.js component with:
  - Flowing particle system with morphing shapes
  - 4 color palettes (warm, cool, nature, monochrome)
  - Dynamic particle connections and glow effects
  - Responsive canvas with resize handling
  - Export functionality built-in
  - Real-time parameter responsiveness

- **App.jsx**: Updated with:
  - State management for colorPalette, motionSpeed, patternDensity
  - Working dropdown for color palette selection
  - Range sliders for motion speed (0.1-3) and density (10-100)  
  - Export button connected to sketch functionality
  - Real-time parameter passing to P5Sketch component

- **App.css**: Added:
  - Styling for interactive controls (.control-input)
  - Focus states with visual feedback
  - Range slider specific styling
  - Canvas border-radius for polish

### Results & Verification  
- P5Sketch component integrates p5.js directly without deprecated react-p5
- Generative art features flowing particles with:
  - Morphing organic shapes based on sine waves
  - Particle-to-particle connections when close
  - Glow effects and dynamic backgrounds
  - Smooth animation loops
- All 3 parameters work in real-time:
  - Color palette: 4 distinct themes
  - Motion speed: 0.1x to 3x multiplier
  - Pattern density: 10-100 particles
- Export saves timestamped PNG files
- Responsive design works on different screen sizes

### Issues/Risks
- Still requires Node.js upgrade to test live functionality
- Canvas performance with high particle density may vary on different devices
- Export feature needs live testing to verify browser compatibility

### Next Steps  
1. Once Node.js compatibility resolved, test all functionality live
2. Proceed to Phase 3: Advanced features and polish
3. Consider adding parameter randomization or presets
4. Test export functionality across browsers
