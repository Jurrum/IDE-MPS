# 🚀 Getting Started with SQL Practice

Welcome! This guide will help you start your SQL learning journey.

## ✅ Pre-Flight Checklist

### Step 1: Install PostgreSQL (30 minutes)

- [ ] Read `setup/installation.md`
- [ ] Download and install PostgreSQL for your OS
- [ ] Set a password for the postgres user (write it down!)
- [ ] Verify installation: `psql --version`
- [ ] Successfully connect to PostgreSQL

**Windows Users**:
```bash
# In PowerShell or Command Prompt
psql -U postgres
# Enter your password when prompted
```

**Mac/Linux Users**:
```bash
# In Terminal
psql postgres
# or
sudo -u postgres psql
```

### Step 2: Learn the Basics (30 minutes)

- [ ] Read `setup/getting-started.md`
- [ ] Practice basic psql commands (`\l`, `\dt`, `\q`)
- [ ] Create a test database
- [ ] Create a simple test table
- [ ] Insert and query some test data

**Quick Test**:
```sql
-- Create test database
CREATE DATABASE test_db;

-- Connect to it
\c test_db

-- Create a simple table
CREATE TABLE test (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO test (name) VALUES ('Hello SQL!');

-- Query it
SELECT * FROM test;

-- Clean up
\c postgres
DROP DATABASE test_db;
```

### Step 3: Set Up Your Workspace (15 minutes)

- [ ] Choose your SQL editor:
  - **psql** (command line - recommended for learning)
  - **pgAdmin 4** (GUI - comes with PostgreSQL)
  - **DBeaver** (free, cross-platform GUI)
  - **VS Code** with PostgreSQL extension
  
- [ ] Open the project folder in your code editor
- [ ] Bookmark `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for easy access
- [ ] Have the PostgreSQL documentation ready: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/

### Step 4: Start Exercise 1 (2-3 hours)

- [ ] Read `exercises/exercise-01/README.md` completely
- [ ] Open `exercises/exercise-01/exercise.sql` in your editor
- [ ] Work through each task
- [ ] Test your queries as you go
- [ ] Check your work with verification queries
- [ ] Compare with `solutions/exercise-01-solution.sql` when done

## 🎯 Learning Tips

### Before Each Exercise:
1. ✅ Read the README completely
2. ✅ Understand the learning objectives
3. ✅ Review any prerequisite concepts
4. ✅ Set up your database/tables as needed

### During Each Exercise:
1. ✅ Work in the provided `exercise.sql` file
2. ✅ Write queries incrementally
3. ✅ Test each query before moving on
4. ✅ Add comments explaining your logic
5. ✅ Don't peek at solutions too early!

### After Each Exercise:
1. ✅ Run all verification queries
2. ✅ Compare your solution with the reference
3. ✅ Note any differences or alternative approaches
4. ✅ Review concepts you found challenging
5. ✅ Try bonus challenges if available

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Can't connect to PostgreSQL?
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
# Windows: Check Services app
# Mac: brew services list
# Linux: sudo systemctl status postgresql

# Try connecting with explicit host
psql -h localhost -U postgres
```

### Forgot postgres password?
- See `setup/installation.md` for password reset instructions

### "Permission denied" errors?
- Make sure you're running as the correct user
- On Linux/Mac, try: `sudo -u postgres psql`

### Query not working?
1. Check for typos in table/column names
2. Verify data types match
3. Use `\d tablename` to see table structure
4. Check if you're connected to the right database (`\c dbname`)

### Syntax errors?
- PostgreSQL is case-sensitive for quoted identifiers
- Check for missing semicolons
- Verify parentheses are balanced
- Use the quick reference for correct syntax
