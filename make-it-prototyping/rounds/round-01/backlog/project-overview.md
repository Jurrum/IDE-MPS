# Project Overview: Interactive Art Generator

## What We're Building
We're creating a simple web application that lets people create beautiful, moving art by adjusting controls like sliders and buttons. Think of it like a digital art studio where you can:

- Watch colorful patterns move and change on your screen
- Adjust settings like colors, speed, and shapes using simple controls
- Save your favorite art creations as images

## The Big Picture
This project is like building a simple game or art tool that runs in a web browser. Anyone can visit the website and start making art without downloading anything.

## Development Progress So Far

### ✅ Step 1: Set Up the Foundation (Completed)
**What we did:** Built the basic structure for our web application.

**In simple terms:** 
- Created a new project folder on the computer
- Installed all the tools and libraries we need
- Set up the basic layout with two main areas:
  - Left side: Where the moving art will appear
  - Right side: Control panel with sliders and buttons

**What it looks like now:**
- A webpage with placeholder text saying "p5.js Canvas Placeholder" 
- A control panel showing where sliders will go for "Color Palette", "Motion Speed", and "Pattern Density"
- An "Export Image" button (not working yet)

**Status:** The foundation is ready, but we found some compatibility issues that need fixing before moving forward.

## Next Steps

### Step 2: Add the Moving Art (Coming Next)
- Replace the placeholder with actual moving, colorful patterns
- Make sure the art displays properly and moves smoothly

### Step 3: Connect the Controls
- Make the sliders actually change the art
- Let people adjust colors, speed, and pattern complexity in real-time

### Step 4: Add Save Feature
- Make the "Export Image" button work
- Let people download their art as image files

### Step 5: Polish and Testing
- Make everything look professional
- Test on different devices and browsers
- Write instructions for how to use it

## Current Challenges
- **Technical Issue:** The tools we're using need a newer version of Node.js (the engine that runs our code)
- **Library Problem:** One of our art-making tools (react-p5) is no longer supported, so we might need to find an alternative

## Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Foundation):** ✅ Complete 
- **Phase 2-6:** Estimated 8-15 hours of development work
- **Target:** Working art generator that people can use and enjoy

## Success Measures
When finished, users should be able to:
1. Open the website in their browser
2. See beautiful, moving art patterns
3. Use simple controls to change how the art looks
4. Save their favorite creations as images
5. Share their art with others
