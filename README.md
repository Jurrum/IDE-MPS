Make-It! Prototyping Rounds â€” Code Repository

This repository contains all code, assets, and documentation for my Making & Prototyping Skills (IDEM221) course work. It is organized per prototyping round with a final, polished recipe at the end.

Course context: self-directed, four annotated prototyping rounds + a final improved/new tutorial; submissions and community cookbook live on Notion; personal reflection via Brightspace; communication via Teams; assessment is pass/fail.

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Focus (personal)

Iâ€™m using this course to deepen skills that connect creative making with data-driven, adaptive systems:

Front-end (web) development â€” creative coding and clarity in communicating prototype purpose (likely React).

Build a simple Neural Network â€” e.g., image recognition from scratch/re-creation.

Relational Databases â€” design + use (e.g., PostgreSQL) to support data-grounded prototypes.

Higher-level Digital Prototyping â€” orchestration (MCP), light agents/automation (n8n/Make/Zapier).
These goals frame how each round is chosen and documented.

ðŸ§­ How to Use This Repo
1) Setup (per project)

Each round-* and the final-recipe folder contains its own README.md with:

What youâ€™ll build and why it matters

Recipe source (IDE Cookbook or external tutorial)

Prereqs & tools (Node/Python/postgres/etc.)

Quick start (install, run, test, build)

Evidence (screens/gifs), reflection, and next steps

The course encourages following recipes (internal or external), annotating the process, and contributing back to the IDE Prototyping Cookbook. If something isnâ€™t finished by a deadline, a work-in-progress is acceptable and can be updated later.

2) Environment

Put secrets in environment/.env files (never commit secrets).

If needed, include Docker (docker-compose.yml) for services like Postgres or vector DBs.

3) Data

Store small sample datasets in data/ (or link to sources).

Add a DATASET.md describing schema, size, license, and acquisition steps.

ðŸ§ª Round Template

Each round subfolder should include the following sections in its README.md:

Overview â€” What skill/tech is targeted? How does it support my learning goals? 

Reflection M&PS

Recipe Source â€” Link to the IDE Cookbook page or external tutorial and note any adaptations.
