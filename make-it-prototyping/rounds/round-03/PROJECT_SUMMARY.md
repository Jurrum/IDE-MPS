## 🎓 Learning Approach

### 1. **Read First**
Start with the README in each exercise folder to understand objectives.

### 2. **Try Yourself**
Work in the `exercise.sql` file. Don't look at solutions immediately!

### 3. **Test Incrementally**
Run queries as you write them. Build complex queries step by step.

### 4. **Check Solutions**
After attempting, compare your solution with the reference in `solutions/`.

### 5. **Experiment**
Modify queries, try variations, break things and fix them.

### 6. **Document**
Add comments to your code explaining your thought process.

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Don't Rush**: Take time to understand each concept
2. **Practice Daily**: Even 30 minutes daily is better than long sessions
3. **Make Mistakes**: Errors are learning opportunities
4. **Use EXPLAIN**: Understand how your queries execute
5. **Read Documentation**: PostgreSQL docs are excellent
6. **Join Communities**: Stack Overflow, Reddit r/SQL, PostgreSQL forums
7. **Build Projects**: Apply skills to your own project ideas
8. **Review Regularly**: Revisit earlier exercises to reinforce learning

## 🔍 Quick Reference

The `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` file contains:
- Common SQL commands
- Query patterns
- Join syntax
- Window function examples
- Performance tips
- psql commands

Keep it open while working through exercises!
