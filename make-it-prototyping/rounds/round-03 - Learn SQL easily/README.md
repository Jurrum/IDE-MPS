<!-- 3. Relational Databases — design + use (e.g., PostgreSQL) to support data-grounded prototypes. -->

# SQL Practice Project: Build Your Own Database

Welcome to your SQL learning journey! This project will guide you through building and working with relational databases using PostgreSQL.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, you will:
- Understand database design principles
- Master SQL syntax for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data
- Learn to design and implement table relationships
- Practice complex queries, joins, and aggregations
- Build a complete database system from scratch

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install PostgreSQL**: Follow the guide in `setup/installation.md`
2. **Learn the basics**: Read `setup/getting-started.md`
3. **Start with Exercise 1**: Work through exercises sequentially
4. **Practice, practice, practice**: Try variations and experiment!

## 📖 Exercise Overview

### Exercise 1: Database Basics & Table Creation
Learn to create databases, design tables, and understand data types.

### Exercise 2: Data Insertion & Querying
Master INSERT, SELECT, WHERE, and basic filtering operations.

### Exercise 3: Relationships & Joins
Understand foreign keys, primary keys, and how to join tables.

### Exercise 4: Advanced Queries & Aggregations
Work with GROUP BY, HAVING, subqueries, and aggregate functions.

### Exercise 5: Final Project
Design and build a complete database system for a real-world scenario.

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Read the instructions carefully** before writing SQL
- **Test your queries** incrementally
- **Check the solutions** only after attempting the exercises
- **Experiment** with variations to deepen understanding
- **Ask questions** and seek help when stuck

## 🛠️ Tools You'll Use

- **PostgreSQL**: The database system
- **psql**: Command-line interface for PostgreSQL
- **pgAdmin** (optional): GUI tool for database management

Happy learning! 🎉
