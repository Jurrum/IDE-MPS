# Exercise 5: Final Project - Build a Complete E-Commerce Database

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

Design and implement a complete database system for an e-commerce platform from scratch. This project combines everything you've learned in Exercises 1-4.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

You will build a database for **"TechStore"** - an online electronics retailer. The system must handle:
- Product catalog management
- Customer accounts
- Shopping carts
- Orders and order items
- Product reviews
- Inventory tracking
- Shipping information

## ðŸŽ¨ Requirements

### Phase 1: Database Design (Planning)

Before writing any code, design your database schema:

1. **Identify Entities**: What main objects does the system need?
   - Customers
   - Products
   - Categories
   - Orders
   - Reviews
   - etc.

2. **Define Relationships**: How do entities relate?
   - One-to-many
   - Many-to-many
   - One-to-one

3. **List Attributes**: What information does each entity store?

4. **Identify Constraints**: What rules must the data follow?
   - Required fields
   - Unique values
   - Value ranges
   - Foreign keys

**Deliverable**: Create an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) on paper or using a tool.

### Phase 2: Database Implementation

#### Task 1: Create the Database

Create a new database called `techstore_db`.

```sql
-- Your code here
```

```

### Phase 3: Populate with Sample Data

Insert realistic sample data:

1. At least 5 categories (Electronics, Computers, Accessories, etc.)
2. At least 20 products across different categories
3. At least 10 customers
4. At least 15 orders with multiple items each

1. **Total Revenue**: Calculate total revenue by month
2. **Top Products**: Find best-selling products by quantity and revenue
3. **Customer Lifetime Value**: Calculate total spending per customer
4. **Average Order Value**: Calculate average order value by month
5. **Category Performance**: Revenue and order count by category

#### Inventory Management

1. **Low Stock Alert**: Products with stock below 10 units
2. **Out of Stock**: Products with zero stock
3. **Inventory Value**: Total value of inventory by category
4. **Stock Movement**: Products ordered in last 30 days

#### Customer Analytics

1. **Top Customers**: Customers by total spending
2. **Customer Segmentation**: Categorize customers by order frequency
3. **Inactive Customers**: Customers who haven't ordered in 90 days
4. **New Customers**: Customers who joined in last month
5. **Customer Retention**: Month-over-month customer retention rate

#### Product Analytics

1. **Product Ratings**: Average rating per product with review count
2. **Top Rated Products**: Products with rating >= 4.5 and at least 5 reviews
3. **Products Without Reviews**: Products that have been ordered but not reviewed
4. **Review Trends**: Average rating by month

```sql
-- Your code here
```

### Phase 5: Advanced Features

Implement these advanced features:

#### Task 1: Stored Procedures

Create stored procedures for:

1. **Place Order**: Takes customer ID and cart items, creates order
2. **Update Inventory**: Decreases stock when order is placed
3. **Cancel Order**: Cancels order and restores inventory
4. **Calculate Shipping**: Calculates shipping cost based on weight/distance

```sql
-- Your code here
```

#### Task 2: Triggers

Create triggers for:

1. **Update Product Timestamp**: Auto-update `updated_date` on product changes
2. **Validate Stock**: Prevent orders if insufficient stock
3. **Update Order Total**: Recalculate order total when items change
4. **Archive Old Orders**: Move completed orders older than 1 year to archive table
