Write code myself, little to no help from AI, just a development plan was used.

# Web Scraper Agent - Development Plan

## Overview
An intelligent web scraping agent that monitors websites for changes, extracts structured data, and delivers automated reports via email.

---

## Core Features

### 1. Website Monitoring
- **Change Detection**
  - Hash-based content comparison
  - Visual diff highlighting (what changed)
  - Configurable check intervals (hourly, daily, weekly)
  - Ignore dynamic elements (timestamps, ads, etc.)
  - Screenshot comparison for visual changes

### 2. Data Extraction
- **Pricing Intelligence**
  - Extract product prices with currency detection
  - Track price history and trends
  - Detect sales/discounts
  - Compare prices across multiple competitors
  - Support for dynamic pricing (JavaScript-rendered content)

- **News & Content Collection**
  - Extract article titles, summaries, and URLs
  - Filter by keywords/topics
  - Detect duplicate content
  - Extract publication dates and authors
  - Support for RSS feeds and APIs where available

### 3. Notification System
- **Email Digests**
  - Daily/weekly summary reports
  - Instant alerts for critical changes (price drops, new articles)
  - HTML-formatted emails with tables and charts
  - Customizable templates
  - Attachment support (CSV exports, screenshots)

### 4. Configuration & Management
- **Target Management**
  - Add/remove websites via config file or UI
  - Define CSS selectors or XPath for data extraction
  - Set monitoring frequency per target
  - Enable/disable targets without deletion
  - Import/export configurations

## Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack
```
Backend:
- Python 3.10+
- Scrapy or BeautifulSoup4 (parsing)
- Playwright/Selenium (JavaScript-heavy sites)
- APScheduler (scheduling)
- SQLite/PostgreSQL (data storage)

Email:
- smtplib + email (built-in)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
**Goal:** Basic scraping and storage

- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Implement base scraper class
- [ ] Create database schema (targets, scrape_results, price_history)
- [ ] Build static HTML scraper with BeautifulSoup
- [ ] Implement basic CSS selector extraction
- [ ] Add configuration file parser (YAML)
- [ ] Write unit tests for core functions

**Deliverable:** Can scrape a static website and store results

### Phase 2: Change Detection (Week 2)
**Goal:** Monitor websites for changes

- [ ] Implement content hashing algorithm
- [ ] Build change detection logic
- [ ] Add diff generation (what changed)
- [ ] Create scheduling system with APScheduler
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and retry logic
- [ ] Add logging and error handling
- [ ] Store historical data for comparison

**Deliverable:** Agent runs on schedule and detects changes

### Phase 3: Data Extraction (Week 3)
**Goal:** Extract structured data

- [ ] Build price extraction module
  - Currency detection and normalization
  - Handle various price formats ($99.99, 99,99€, etc.)
  - Extract original vs. sale prices
- [ ] Build article extraction module
  - Title, URL, summary extraction
  - Date parsing and normalization
  - Author/source identification
- [ ] Add keyword filtering
- [ ] Implement data validation and cleaning
- [ ] Create data export functions (JSON, CSV)

**Deliverable:** Extracts and structures pricing and article data

### Phase 4: Dynamic Content (Week 4)
**Goal:** Handle JavaScript-rendered sites

- [ ] Integrate Playwright for browser automation
- [ ] Implement dynamic scraper class
- [ ] Add wait strategies (wait for selectors, network idle)
- [ ] Handle pagination and infinite scroll
- [ ] Implement cookie consent handling
- [ ] Add screenshot capture functionality
- [ ] Optimize for performance (headless mode, resource blocking)

**Deliverable:** Can scrape modern JavaScript-heavy websites

### Phase 5: Notifications (Week 5)
**Goal:** Email digest system

- [ ] Set up SMTP configuration
- [ ] Create email templates with Jinja2
  - Daily digest template
  - Instant alert template
  - Price comparison template
- [ ] Implement email sender with attachments
- [ ] Add HTML formatting with charts (matplotlib/plotly)
- [ ] Build notification rules engine
- [ ] Add email scheduling logic
- [ ] Test with various email clients

**Deliverable:** Sends formatted email reports

### Phase 6: Polish & Deployment (Week 6)
**Goal:** Production-ready agent

- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Implement health checks and monitoring
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Add CLI interface for management
- [ ] Optional: Build simple web UI (FastAPI + HTML)
- [ ] Write deployment guide
- [ ] Create Docker container
- [ ] Set up automated testing (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Performance optimization

**Deliverable:** Production-ready, deployable agent

## Configuration Example

### targets.yaml
```yaml
targets:
  - name: "Competitor Product A"
    url: "https://example.com/product/123"
    type: "price"
    schedule: "0 */6 * * *"  # Every 6 hours
    selectors:
      price: ".product-price"
      title: "h1.product-title"
      availability: ".stock-status"
    notify_on:
      - price_drop: 5%  # Alert if price drops 5%+
      - out_of_stock: true
    
  - name: "Tech News Site"
    url: "https://technews.com/latest"
    type: "articles"
    schedule: "0 9 * * *"  # Daily at 9 AM
    selectors:
      articles: ".article-card"
      title: "h2.title"
      link: "a.read-more"
      date: ".publish-date"
    keywords:
      - "AI"
      - "machine learning"
      - "automation"
    max_articles: 10

email:
  smtp_server: "smtp.gmail.com"
  smtp_port: 587
  sender: "agent@example.com"
  recipients:
    - "you@example.com"
  digest_schedule: "0 8 * * *"  # Daily at 8 AM
```

## Key Considerations

### Legal & Ethical
- [ ] Respect robots.txt
- [ ] Implement rate limiting (don't overload servers)
- [ ] Add user-agent identification
- [ ] Check terms of service for each target site
- [ ] Consider using official APIs where available

### Performance
- [ ] Cache results to minimize requests
- [ ] Use connection pooling
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff for retries
- [ ] Monitor memory usage for large scrapes
- [ ] Consider async/await for concurrent scraping

### Reliability
- [ ] Handle network failures gracefully
- [ ] Detect and adapt to website structure changes
- [ ] Log all errors with context
- [ ] Implement health monitoring
- [ ] Set up alerts for agent failures

### Security
- [ ] Store credentials securely (environment variables)
- [ ] Sanitize extracted data before storage
- [ ] Validate URLs before scraping
- [ ] Use HTTPS for email transmission
- [ ] Don't expose sensitive data in logs

## Success Metrics

- **Reliability:** 99%+ uptime, successful scrapes
- **Accuracy:** <1% false positive change detection
- **Performance:** Complete scrape cycle in <5 minutes
- **Timeliness:** Email digests sent within 5 minutes of schedule
- **Coverage:** Successfully scrape 95%+ of configured targets

---

## Future Enhancements

- Web dashboard for configuration and monitoring
- Support for authenticated websites (login required)
- Natural language queries ("notify me when price drops below $50")
- Integration with Slack, Discord, or other platforms
- Machine learning for automatic selector detection
- Proxy rotation for large-scale scraping
- Mobile app notifications
- API for third-party integrations
