# Solutions Guide

This directory contains reference solutions for all SQL practice exercises.

## üìù Important Notes

- **Try the exercises first!** Only refer to solutions after attempting the problems yourself
- Solutions may have multiple correct approaches - yours might be different but still valid
- Use solutions to learn alternative techniques and best practices
- Compare your solution with the reference to understand different approaches

## üéØ How to Use Solutions

### 1. Self-Assessment
```sql
-- First, try the exercise yourself
-- Then compare with solution
-- Note differences and learn from them
```

### 2. Learning Alternative Approaches
```sql
-- Your solution might use a subquery:
SELECT * FROM books 
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM books);

-- Solution might use a window function:
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT *, AVG(price) OVER() as avg_price 
    FROM books
) sub WHERE price > avg_price;

-- Both are correct! Learn when to use each.
```

### 3. Understanding Best Practices
Solutions demonstrate:
- Proper naming conventions
- Efficient query patterns
- Index usage
- Constraint implementation
- Code organization

## üí° Tips for Learning

1. **Don't just copy** - Understand why the solution works
2. **Experiment** - Modify solutions to see different outcomes
3. **Compare performance** - Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE on different approaches
4. **Ask questions** - If you don't understand something, research it
5. **Practice variations** - Try similar problems with different data

## üîç Common Patterns in Solutions

### Pattern 1: Defensive Programming
```sql
-- Always check before deleting
SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition;  -- Preview
DELETE FROM table WHERE condition;    -- Then delete
```

### Pattern 2: Using CTEs for Readability
```sql
WITH summary AS (
    SELECT category, COUNT(*) as count
    FROM products
    GROUP BY category
)
SELECT * FROM summary WHERE count > 5;
```

### Pattern 3: Proper Join Order
```sql
-- Start with the main table, then join related tables
SELECT b.title, c.name, a.author_name
FROM books b
LEFT JOIN categories c ON b.category_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN book_authors ba ON b.id = ba.book_id
LEFT JOIN authors a ON ba.author_id = a.id;
```

## üêõ Debugging Your Solutions

If your solution doesn't match the expected output:

1. **Check data types** - Ensure columns have correct types
2. **Verify constraints** - Check if constraints are properly set
3. **Test incrementally** - Build complex queries step by step
4. **Use EXPLAIN** - Understand query execution
5. **Check for NULLs** - Handle NULL values appropriately

## üìä Performance Comparison

Solutions include performance considerations:

```sql
-- Slower: Subquery in SELECT
SELECT 
    title,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM loans WHERE book_id = books.id) as loan_count
FROM books;

-- Faster: JOIN with GROUP BY
SELECT 
    b.title,
    COUNT(l.id) as loan_count
FROM books b
LEFT JOIN loans l ON b.id = l.book_id
GROUP BY b.id, b.title;
```

## üéì Advanced Topics Covered
